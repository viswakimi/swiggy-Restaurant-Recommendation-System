# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **restaurant recommendation system** that suggests restaurants based on user preferences. It uses **clustering and similarity measures** to find relevant restaurants based on features such as **city, cuisine, rating, and cost**. The system is integrated into a **Streamlit application** for easy user interaction.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms restaurant data for analysis.
- **Encoding:** Applies **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features.
- **Clustering & Similarity Measures:** Uses **K-Means Clustering** or **Cosine Similarity** to identify similar restaurants.
- **Result Mapping:** Maps recommendation results back to the original dataset.
- **Streamlit Application:** Provides an **interactive web interface** for users to get personalized restaurant recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of restaurant details, including:
- **Name**
- **City**
- **Cuisine**
- **Rating**
- **Rating Count**
- **Cost**
- **Address**
- **Menu Link**

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Handled missing values.
- Converted categorical columns to appropriate formats.
- Transformed cost and rating fields into numeric values.

### 2. Encoding
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features (e.g., city, cuisine).
- Saved the encoder as a **Pickle file (`encoder.pkl`)**.
- Ensured all features are numerical after encoding.
- Created a preprocessed dataset (`encoded_data.csv`).
- Matched the indices of `cleaned_data.csv` and `encoded_data.csv`.

### 3. Recommendation Methodology
- Implemented **K-Means Clustering** and **Cosine Similarity** to group and recommend restaurants.
- Used encoded numerical data for computations.

### 4. Result Mapping
- Mapped the recommendation results (indices) back to the **non-encoded dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`)**.

### 5. Streamlit Application
Built an **interactive web application** that:
- **Accepts user input** (e.g., preferred city, cuisine, rating, price range).
- **Processes the input** and queries the encoded dataset for recommendations.
- **Displays recommended restaurants** using `cleaned_data.csv`.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** and install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit seaborn plotly
```

## Running the Application
Run the Streamlit app using:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Future Improvements
- Improve the recommendation algorithm by incorporating user reviews.
- Implement a **hybrid model** combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
- Add a **real-time API** for live restaurant data integration.
- Enhance the **Streamlit UI** with better filtering and visualization options.
